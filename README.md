# 2. Testing

The shirt.js file has some extra data entries that affect the display of T-Shirt products on both products.html and detail.html pages. If a T-Shirt doesn't have a name, it will be displayed as "Unnamed". Similarly, if a T-Shirt doesn't have any available colors, default images will be displayed. The Side and Color button block on the detail.html page will display "Not Available". If a T-Shirt doesn't have a price, the text "Not on sale" will be displayed in the price block. Finally, if a T-Shirt doesn't have a description, the text "TBA..." will be displayed as its description.
